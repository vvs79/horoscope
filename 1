Capricorn Weekly Horoscope
Your professional sector of career, goals, and ambitions gets a double boost as Venus encourages charm and tact as a way to seal deals and get a promotion or new project. Once Mars moves into the same zone midweek, you could be more openly competitive and willing to use charm to get where you need to go. The New Moon can be helpful for moving in new social circles and joining groups that support your interests. Some positive new friendships can be made now.
