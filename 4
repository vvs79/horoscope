Aries Weekly Horoscope
Though sensitive to other people's feelings, your determination to reach a goal or achieve a certain outcome could see you pushing ahead regardless. And if you're really eager to initiate change, do so in tandem with Wednesday's Scorpio New Moon, when you'll get projects off to a great start. Mars enters Libra on Thursday, which could be excellent for teamwork if you can toe the line. If you're in an assertive mood, you may not tolerate too much niceness.
