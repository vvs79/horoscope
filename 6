Gemini Weekly Horoscope
You've been busy renovating and doing for some time now, but this week the mood shifts to leisure and pleasure. But the focus on work and lifestyle continues, with the New Moon bringing the option of a fresh beginning. If you felt like restarting your exercise routine or diet, this is the best time to do it. Get a personal trainer if you need motivation and you'll soon be in great shape. When it comes to romance, keep things light and easy for now.
