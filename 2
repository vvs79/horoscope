Aquarius Weekly Horoscope
Thoughts of travel and exotic destinations may fuel a desire to make holiday plans or jet off for a short break if you need a change of pace. And it seems there will be no shortage of romantic opportunities, especially with Venus and Mars increasing the likelihood of instant attractions and lighthearted dates. On another note, the New Moon in your career zone on Wednesday could be one of the better times to kick-start the next stage of a business plan.
