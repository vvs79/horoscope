Pisces Weekly Horoscope
The option to expand your horizons can mean you're attracted to courses, workshops, or travel. Inner journeys also count here, so opting for a retreat in which you might better know yourself is equally valid. Money matters, particularly regarding shared resources and business matters, get a boost as Mars jogs into Libra, stirring up a desire to increase your earnings or create more income streams. Balance hard work with relaxation to avoid burnout.
