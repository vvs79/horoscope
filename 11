Scorpio Weekly Horoscope
This week's New Moon in your sign brings a golden opportunity for a fresh start. If you make a point of starting a new project, job, or challenge on or shortly after midweek, the Moon tide will give your efforts a boost, resulting in a more successful outcome. However, as Mars dances into Libra, it encourages you to get rid of some of the baggage you've been carrying around. Meditation, other spiritual practices, or journaling might help with this.
