Libra Weekly Horoscope
Venus, newly in your sign, means you're well and truly in your element. Others will greatly appreciate your personality traits, grace, and charm. Mars enters your sign on Thursday, which could mean that you'll firmly defend your boundaries, which has to be a good thing. You'll find it useful to haggle when out shopping, especially if you're eager to purchase items for the home. Your intuition can play a part in securing a bargain, too.
