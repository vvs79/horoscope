Leo Weekly Horoscope
You need to make a key decision on Tuesday. The midweek New Moon in your home zone encourages new beginnings, so if you're ready to start on a project or the next phase of a plan, this is the time to make your move. Whatever you begin now could change your life for the better in some way. Meanwhile, Mars joins Venus in Libra on Thursday, so it's an excellent time to advertise your goods and services and get your message out.
