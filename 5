Taurus Weekly Horoscope
The Sun and Mercury in Scorpio certainly add passion to relationships, particularly your love life, but they can also spotlight verbal battles and control issues. While Venus in Libra might encourage you to compromise, in practice you may resist doing so. However, the midweek New Moon can be an opportunity for a fresh start if you're open to it. Meanwhile, on Friday you may feel like spending a night alone with a good book or movie so you can unwind.
